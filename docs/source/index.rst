GCSFS
=====

A pythonic file-system interface to `Google Cloud Storage`_.

This software is beta, use at your own risk.

Please file issues and requests on github_ and we welcome pull requests.

.. _github: https://github.com/fsspec/gcsfs/issues


This package depends on fsspec_, and inherits many useful behaviours from there,
including integration with Dask, and the facility for key-value dict-like
objects of the type used by zarr.

Installation
------------

The GCSFS library can be installed using ``conda``:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge gcsfs

or ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install gcsfs

or by cloning the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/fsspec/gcsfs/
   cd gcsfs/
   pip install .

Examples
--------

Locate and read a file:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import gcsfs
   >>> fs = gcsfs.GCSFileSystem(project='my-google-project')
   >>> fs.ls('my-bucket')
   ['my-file.txt']
   >>> with fs.open('my-bucket/my-file.txt', 'rb') as f:
   ...     print(f.read())
   b'Hello, world'

(see also :meth:`~gcsfs.core.GCSFileSystem.walk` and :meth:`~gcsfs.core.GCSFileSystem.glob`)

Read with delimited blocks:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> fs.read_block(path, offset=1000, length=10, delimiter=b'\n')
   b'A whole line of text\n'

Write with blocked caching:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> with fs.open('mybucket/new-file', 'wb') as f:
   ...     f.write(2*2**20 * b'a')
   ...     f.write(2*2**20 * b'a') # data is flushed and file closed
   >>> fs.du('mybucket/new-file')
   {'mybucket/new-file': 4194304}

Because GCSFS faithfully copies the Python file interface it can be used
smoothly with other projects that consume the file interface like ``gzip`` or
``pandas``.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> with fs.open('mybucket/my-file.csv.gz', 'rb') as f:
   ...     g = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f)  # Decompress data with gzip
   ...     df = pd.read_csv(g)           # Read CSV file with Pandas

Credentials
-----------

Several modes of authentication are supported:

    - if ``token=None`` (default), GCSFS will attempt to use your default gcloud
      credentials or, attempt to get credentials from the google metadata
      service, or fall back to anonymous access. This will work for most
      users without further action. Note that the default project may also
      be found, but it is often best to supply this anyway (only affects bucket-
      level operations).

    - if ``token='cloud'``, we assume we are running within google (compute
      or container engine) and fetch the credentials automatically from the
      metadata service.

    - you may supply a token generated by the
      gcloud_ utility; this is either a python dictionary, or the name of a file
      containing the JSON returned by logging in with the gcloud CLI tool (e.g.,
      ``~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`` or
      ``~/.config/gcloud/legacy_credentials/<YOUR GOOGLE USERNAME>/adc.json``)
      or any value google ``Credentials`` object.

    - you can also generate tokens via Oauth2 in the browser using ``token='browser'``,
      which gcsfs then caches in a special file, ~/.gcs_tokens, and can subsequently be accessed with ``token='cache'``.

    - anonymous only access can be selected using ``token='anon'``, e.g. to access
      public resources such as 'anaconda-public-data'.

The acquired session tokens are *not* preserved when serializing the instances, so
it is safe to pass them to worker processes on other machines if using in a
distributed computation context. If credentials are given by a file path, however,
then this file must exist on every machine.


Integration
-----------

The libraries ``intake``, ``pandas`` and ``dask`` accept URLs with the prefix
"gcs://", and will use gcsfs to complete the IO operation in question. The
IO functions take an argument ``storage_options``, which will be passed
to ``GCSFileSystem``, for example:

.. code-block:: python

   df = pd.read_excel("gcs://bucket/path/file.xls",
                      storage_options={"token": "anon"})

This gives the chance to pass any credentials or other necessary
arguments needed to gcsfs.


Async
-----

``gcsfs`` is implemented using ``aiohttp``, and offers async functionality.
A number of methods of ``GCSFileSystem`` are ``async``, for for each of these,
there is also a synchronous version with the same name and lack of a "_"
prefix.

If you wish to call ``gcsfs`` from async code, then you should pass
``asynchronous=True, loop=loop`` to the constructor (the latter is optional,
if you wish to use both async and sync methods). You must also explicitly
await the client creation before making any GCS call.

.. code-block:: python

    async def run_program():
        gcs = GCSFileSystem(asynchronous=True)
        print(await gcs._ls(""))

    asyncio.run(run_program())  # or call from your async code

Concurrent async operations are also used internally for bulk operations
such as ``pipe/cat``, ``get/put``, ``cp/mv/rm``. The async calls are
hidden behind a synchronisation layer, so are designed to be called
from normal code. If you are *not*
using async-style programming, you do not need to know about how this
works, but you might find the implementation interesting.

For every synchronous function there is asynchronous one prefixed by ``_``, but
the ``open`` operation does not support async operation. If you need it to open
some file in async manner, it's better to asynchronously download it to
temporary location and working with it from there.

Proxy
-----

``gcsfs`` uses ``aiohttp`` for calls to the storage api, which by default
ignores ``HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY`` environment variables. To read
proxy settings from the environment provide ``session_kwargs`` as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   fs = GCSFileSystem(project='my-google-project', session_kwargs={'trust_env': True})

For further reference check `aiohttp proxy support`_.
